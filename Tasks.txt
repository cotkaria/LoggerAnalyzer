Tasks:
-disable if searchHistory is empty: SearchHistory pane & ClearButton --DONE
-no selection of cursor initially --TBD
-save config onCloseApp -- DONE
-Add settings for App: pattern for searched folder
					   the extension of the file that must be uploaded
					   pattern of the date and time in the folder name
					   read the default values for settings from an ini file
-MultiThreaded Search
-!!!on focus set on various buttons, perform the according action on Enter key pressed (TBD as a setting in menu)
Rejected Ideas:
-initially disable: - UploadButton(Solved using PopUp Error)
-search should be done only after a parameters change (you'd have to clear to do a search with the same parameters) - Not necessary for it complicates the usage of App
